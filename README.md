# B-29 UVA Whistleblower App

__Contributors:__ Cole Edwards (wsy3ux), Ethan Banjeree (fhh4fg), Hao Gu (jkq8eb), Daniel Nedialkov (ddn4fw), and Artie Humphries (bsg6vr)

__Project Description:__ The UVA Bullying Whistleblower App provides a platform for individuals to report instances of bullying at UVA. This app was made for a group project in UVA's CS 3240.

__How to Use the Project:__ You can access the project at this link: https://uvawhistleblower-69c7257a6742.herokuapp.com/. You can report bullying by clicking on the Report Bullying button that is located on both the Home and Profile pages. When reporting bullying you can input four different fields: a title, a file (.txt, .pdf, and .jpg), a description, and a tag (type of bullying). You can create or sign into a common user buy clicking the login button. Once logged into a common user, you can see all of your previous reports in the profile page. Here you can see all the original fields when you reported an instance, as well as report status, a note from a site admin, and an upload date and time. Common users can also edit the title, description, and type of bullying on all their previous reports by clicking the edit submission button. Common users can also delete all reports they previously posted. Site admins can see all reports posted in their profile page. When a site admin clicks on a new report, the status automatically changes to in progress. Site admins can also resolve reports by clicking the resolve submission button on any individual report. This gives the site admin to leave a note that the common user who created the report can see.
